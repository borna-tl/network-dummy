# Single-Hop Tunneling Server and Client

## Overview
This implements a single-hop UDP tunneling system using IPv6 addressing where a tunneling server (tvpns) forwards UDP packets between a client and a final destination, hiding the true source and destination identities. The implementation specifically handles link-local IPv6 addresses common in lab environments.

## Files
- `tvpns.c` - Tunneling server that accepts TCP control connections and forwards UDP data
- `tvpnc.c` - Tunneling client that sets up tunnel sessions via TCP
- `utilities.c` - Some utilities used by tvpns
- `server_child.c` - After forking in tvpns, the child portion is included in this file to handle communication with ping server
- `Makefile` - Build script

## IPv6 Addressing Details

This version uses IPv6 addressing throughout:
- All IP addresses are IPv6 (e.g., fe80::...)
- Uses `struct sockaddr_in6` instead of `sockaddr_in`
- Creates sockets with `AF_INET6` instead of `AF_INET`
- Link-local addresses (fe80::...) require interface scope IDs

### Link-Local Address Handling
- Link-local IPv6 addresses (starting with fe80::) are only valid within a single network interface
- When using link-local addresses, you must specify which interface to use via a "scope ID"
- You can append %interface (e.g., fe80::1234:5678%eth0) to a link-local address
- The code uses `if_nametoindex()` to convert interface names to scope IDs at runtime
- This allows the same code to work across different amber lab machines without hardcoding interface details

## Functions & Methods (detailed)

This section lists the main functions across the codebase and describes their roles and important behavior. 

- `int main(int argc, char *argv[])` (in `tvpns.c`)
  - Program entry for the tunneling server. Validates CLI args (`server_ip`, `port`, `secret`), checks the secret length (6 bytes), initializes the forwarding table (`initialize_forward_table()`), and sets `SIGCHLD` to `SIG_IGN` to avoid zombies.
  - Creates a TCP listening socket, binds to the provided server IP and port, and calls `listen()`.
  - Accepts TCP connections in a loop. For each accepted connection it reads a 2-byte connection request (expects value 315), a 6-byte secret (verifies it), a 16-byte destination IPv6 address, a 2-byte destination port, and a 16-byte source IPv6 address.
  - Finds a free session slot via `find_free_session_slot()` and populates the `forwardtab` entry with the dest/source addresses and destination port. It then forks a child and calls `run_child_session()` in the child to handle forwarding for that session.

- `void initialize_forward_table()` (in `utilities.c`)
  - Zeroes the global `forwardtab` array. Called at server startup to mark all session slots free.

- `int find_free_session_slot()` (in `utilities.c`)
  - Scans the `forwardtab` array for an entry whose `sourceaddr` is 0 (unused) and returns its index or -1 if none available.

- `void run_child_session(int session_idx, int client_sockfd, char *secret)` (in `server_child.c`)
  - Executed in a forked child to handle one tunneling session end-to-end.
  - Creates two UDP sockets:
    - A *client-facing* UDP socket bound to the first available port starting at `BASE_UDP_PORT` (55500). This is the port the client will send UDP packets to.
    - A *destination-facing* UDP socket bound to the first available port starting at `BASE_TUNNEL_PORT` (57500). This socket is used to send to and receive from the true destination.
  - Sends an 8-byte TCP response back to the control client containing the 6-byte secret followed by the 2-byte assigned client UDP port (network byte order).
  - Enters a `select()` loop monitoring the TCP control socket and both UDP sockets:
    - If the TCP control socket becomes readable and a valid 6-byte secret termination message is received, the child tears down sockets and exits.
    - When data arrives on the client-facing UDP socket, the child records the client's source port (first packet), forwards the payload to the destination address/port stored in the session table via `sendto()` on the destination-facing socket.
    - When data arrives on the destination-facing UDP socket, the child forwards it to the client by sending to the client's IP/port using the client-facing socket.
  - The child updates `forwardtab[session_idx].sourcept` on first-packet receipt to enable correct return-path forwarding.

- `int main(int argc, char *argv[])` (in `tvpnc.c`)
  - Program entry for the tunneling client. Validates CLI args (`server_ip`, `server_port`, `secret`, `client_ip`, `dest_ip`, `dest_port`) and creates a TCP socket to connect to the tunneling server.
  - Sends a 2-byte connection request with value 315 (network byte order), the 6-byte secret, the 16-byte destination IPv6 address (network order), the 2-byte destination port (network order), and the 16-byte source IPv6 address (network order).
  - Reads the server's 8-byte response (6-byte secret + 2-byte assigned UDP port). Verifies the secret and prints the assigned UDP port and a suggested `udppingc` command.
  - Keeps the TCP connection open until the user hits Enter, at which point it sends the 6-byte secret as a termination request and closes the connection.

## Compilation
```bash
make
```

This creates two executables: `tvpns` and `tvpnc`

## Usage

### 1. Start the tunneling server (tvpns)
Run on a lab machine (e.g., amber05):
```bash
./tvpns fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:fc43 61112 abcABC
```

Parameters:
- `fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:fc43` - Server's IPv6 address
- `61112` - TCP port for control connections
- `abcABC` - 6-character secret key

### 2. Start the UDP ping server (udppings)
Run on destination machine (e.g., amber06):
```bash
./udppings 56001 abcABC
```
- Note: for the ping application, we are using our code from part 1 available in in ```lab4/v1```.
### 3. Set up tunnel (tvpnc)
Run on a client machine (e.g., amber02):
```bash
./tvpnc fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:fc43 61112 abcABC fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe46:31c4 fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:ddb8 56001
```

Parameters:
- `fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:fc43 61112` - Tunneling server coordinates
- `abcABC` - Secret key (must match server)
- `fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe46:31c4` - UDP client machine IPv6 (e.g., amber04)
- `fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:ddb8 56001` - Final destination ping server coordinates (e.g., amber06)

The client will output the UDP port number to use (e.g., 55502)

### 4. Run UDP ping client (udppingc)
Run on client machine (e.g., amber04):
```bash
./udppingc fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:fc43 55502 abcABC 50001 10
```

Parameters:
- `fe80::a6bb:6dff:fe44:fc43` - Tunneling server IPv6 (NOT ping server IP)
- `55502` - Port returned by tvpnc
- `abcABC` - Ping authentication secret
- `50001` - Local port for client to bind
- `10` - Number of ping packets

## Protocol Details

### Control Plane (TCP)
The tunneling server uses TCP for session setup and teardown:

**Setup Request (from tvpnc to tvpns):**
1. 2 bytes: Connection request (value 315 in network byte order)
2. 6 bytes: Secret key
3. 16 bytes: Destination IPv6 address
4. 2 bytes: Destination port (network byte order)
5. 16 bytes: Source IPv6 address

**Setup Response (from tvpns to tvpnc):**
1. 6 bytes: Secret key (verification)
2. 2 bytes: UDP port number (network byte order)

**Teardown Request:**
- 6 bytes: Secret key (sent by tvpnc to terminate session)

### Data Plane (UDP)
- Client sends UDP packets to tvpns at the assigned port
- tvpns forwards packets to final destination
- Responses from destination are forwarded back to client
- Client is unaware of true destination; destination sees tvpns as source

## Architecture

### tvpns (Server)
- **Parent Process**: Listens on TCP socket for control connections
  - Validates connection requests (value 315)
  - Verifies secret key
  - Maintains forwarding table (max 8 sessions)
  - Forks child processes for each session

- **Child Process**: Handles packet forwarding
  - Creates two UDP sockets:
    - Socket 1: Binds to port 55500+ for client communication
    - Socket 2: Binds to port 57500+ for destination communication
  - Uses `select()` to monitor TCP and both UDP sockets
  - Forwards packets bidirectionally
  - Terminates on secret key received via TCP

### tvpnc (Client)
- Connects to tvpns via TCP
- Sends tunnel setup request with destination info
- Receives UDP port for data transmission
- Waits for user input to terminate session
- Sends termination request

## Forwarding Table Structure
```c
struct tunneltab {
    struct in6_addr destaddr;    // Destination IPv6 address
    unsigned short destpt;       // Destination port
    struct in6_addr sourceaddr;  // Source IPv6 address
    unsigned short sourcept;     // Source port (dynamically assigned)
    unsigned short tunnelpt;     // Tunnel port (dynamically assigned)
    uint32_t scope_id;          // Interface scope ID for link-local addresses
};
```

## Notes
- All multi-byte integers use network byte order (big-endian)
- Maximum of 8 simultaneous tunneling sessions (NUMSESSIONS)
- UDP ports start at 55500 for client sockets
- UDP ports start at 57500 for tunnel sockets
- Secret key must be exactly 6 ASCII characters
- Secret key is sent from the client and received on server to request termination.
- Connection request value must be exactly 315
- IPv6 link-local addresses require proper interface scope IDs
- Use if_nametoindex() to get scope IDs at runtime instead of hardcoding
